Module 9 Challenge---
First part of this challenge, we have to look at .csv files and show the relationships between files/tables. The sketching was done with QuickDBD. I exported the sketch and saved in a folder named pt1_DataModeling. 
Second paart, I used postgresql and created tables with primary keys and foreign keys when needed. Afterwards, i imported all the scv files for the tables. This part can be found in the folder named pt2_DataAnalysis. 
third part, I used postgresql to query the tables and answer specific questions utalizing joins when necessary. This part can be foound in the folder named pt3_DataEngineering.
