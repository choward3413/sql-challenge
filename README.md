Module 9 Challenge
First part of this challenge, we have to look at csv files and show the relationships. The sketching was done with QuickDBD. I exported the sketch and saved in a folder named pt1_DataModeling. 
Second paart, I used postgresql and created tables with primary keys and foreign keys when needed. Afterwards, i imported all the scv files for the tables.
third part, I used postgresql to query the tables and answer specific questions utalizing joins when necessary.
